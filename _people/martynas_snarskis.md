I am a Brain and Cognitive Science Major and Take 5 scholar (Foundations of Mathematics and Formal Systems). I'm studying approximate inference in human decision-making, designing a task to measure just how approximate our judgements are. I am also studying how our confidence judgements are biased by various stimulus statistics. I also help out as a lab manager and website developer.
