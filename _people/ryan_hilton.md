# About Me
* I am currently an undergraduate student in the [Georgen Institute of Data Science](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/dsc/) at [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu), co-advised by Prof. [Ralf Haefner](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/haefner_ralf/index.html) and graduate student, Anton Platenev.
* My research interest lies in understanding the relationship between human inference processes and machine learning processes. This is including but not limited to: 
  1. how computational models of human inference processes can be used to build more complex AI;
  1. how can we build/mimic humanlike qualities (e.g. creativity, emotion, imagination) in machines;
# Current Work
* Right now, I am analyzing methods of tracking, identifying, and labelling individual neurons over discrete intermittent recording sessions.
