# About Me
* I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/) at [University of Rochester](https://rochester.edu), co-advised by Prof. [Ralf Haefner](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/people/faculty/haefner_ralf/index.html) and Prof. [Krishnan Padmanabhan](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/29791170-krishnan-padmanabhan).
* My research interest lies in understanding the principles and mechanisms of computations performed by the mammalian brain at the level of both individual neurons and neuronal circuits. Specifically, I am interested in building dynamical/mechanistic neuronal network models and developing theoretical methods to analyze the activity of large populations of neurons to study: 
  1. how patterns of neural activity are used to represent features of the sensory world;
  1. how centrifugal feedback influences these patterns;
  1. how these patterns generate motor behaviors;
  1. at a higher level, how the neuronal circuits perform inference and represent uncertainty.
