### About me

I am a PhD student in the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at University of Rochester, where I am advised by Ralf Haefner.

I am interested in studying perception and decision making in a normative framework. My research focuses on approximate inference in the brain (primarily sampling), causal inference in multisensory perception, hierarchical motion perception and active inference for decision making.
