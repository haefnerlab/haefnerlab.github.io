### About me

I am a graduate student advised by Ralf Haefner in the department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at University of Rochester.

I am interested in using machine learning techniques and mathematical tools to understand the visual processing system. My research projects include understanding perceptual biases in visual decision making and explaining them as consequences of sampling based approximate inference algorithms, building biophysically realistic network of neurons that can implement sampling based inference and understanding mechanisms of active inference in decision making.
